Specifying a language in an \ac{ITP} is seldom faithful
to its original pen-and-paper specification. However the process of mechanizing the
language and type safety proofs might unearth insights for clearer overall specification.
In the present we discuss the process of extending a mechanization of \textit{\ac{FJ}}
with \textit{\ac{FFJ}} in \texttt{Coq} which we name as \textit{\ac{FFJ+}} and how that lead us to a
clearer, unambiguous and equivalent syntax and semantics while keeping the proofs as well as \ac{FJ} extension as simple as possible.
This is also the first mechanization of a \textit{\ac{FOP}} language to date.
