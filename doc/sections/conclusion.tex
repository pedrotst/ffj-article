\section{Conclusion}\label{seq:conclusion}

Testing and proving software product lines (SPL) properties 
(such as type safety and safe evolution) have been 
considered challenging tasks. This situation occurs because   
it is usually impractical to verify properties of all possible 
instances of a software product line and because 
the verification process have to consider different artifacts, 
such as feature models, configuration models, and the SPL asset 
base (that is, requirement models, source code, and so on). 
To partially solve this problem, verification approaches often  
assume that the underlying asset base conforms to a set 
of assumptions{\color{red}, which might \ldots}. To mitigate this problem, in this paper we 
present a slight extension (\ac{FFJ+}) of a core 
calculus for feature-oriented programming, named 
\emph{Feature Featherweight Java} (\ac{FFJ}). \ac{FFJ+} was designed 
side by side with its formalization using Coq and, to the best 
of our knowledge, we are the first to mechanize \ac{FFJ}.  
We believe that such a formalization might help future research efforts 
to full automatize the verification of product line properties 
considering all related assets.
